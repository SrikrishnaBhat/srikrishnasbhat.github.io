I am a Computer Scientist interested in Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCIs), Human Perception, and Machine Learning.
I have successfully defended my PhD at the University of Queensland, where my work focused on passive Brain–Computer
Interfaces (p-BCIs) and Extended Reality (XR).

My doctoral research involved developing Virtual Reality (VR)–based training systems with Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA).
More broadly, I am interested in designing Machine Learning (ML) and XR systems that are empathetic to human users, essentially,
systems that support and augment people rather than replace them. Through my PhD, I gained advanced expertise in ML, XR, and
physiological signals. Although my background is highly technical, my research is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing on
Machine Learning, Cognitive Psychology, and Human–Computer Interaction.

Before my PhD, I worked as a Staff Software Engineer (Band 7A, equivalent to Senior Software Engineer) at
IBM India Software Labs, Bengaluru, Karnataka, on the Watson Machine Learning (WML) team. There, I contributed to building robust
cloud infrastructure for training and deploying Machine Learning models. My time at IBM instilled in me a strong discipline for writing 
effective, maintainable, and modular code.
