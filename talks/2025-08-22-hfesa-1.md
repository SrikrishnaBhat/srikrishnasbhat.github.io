This work explores Cognitively Adaptive Training Systems in Virtual Reality (VR), where task 
difficulty adjusts in real time based on user workload. Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electrodermal 
(EDA) signals are used to train a machine learning model to classify cognitive load during a LEGO™ model-building 
task. Domain adaptation enables the model to generalize across participants and use open-source data. The 
model is integrated into a VR training system and compared with non-adaptive and performance-adaptive 
systems. While perceived workload remained similar, the cognitively adaptive system led to better 
performance and reduced workload, suggesting improved training effectiveness.
